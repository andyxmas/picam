picam

Inital idea is this:
 - function to take a photo using the raspicam
 - function to upload photo to google drive (or similar?)
 - call this function with a cron job


 1. Borrow code from here: http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2013/06/testing-multiple-pi-camera-options-with-python/ to write a function that takes a photo. [done]
 2. upload to google drive may be more hassle that its worth right now. think just sshing it to web server might make better sense. try: subprocess.Popen(["scp", filename, "%(user)s@%(server)s:%(remotepath)s" % vars]).wait()  from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/68335/how-do-i-copy-a-file-to-a-remote-server-in-python-using-scp-or-ssh
