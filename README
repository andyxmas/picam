Daylight
========

Simple function to return true if the current time is between sunrise and sunset.

Current intened use if to stop the raspberry pi cam taking photos when its dark.

Requirements
------------
 * python dateutils to parse date string to timedate
   sudo apt-get install python-dateutil


Plan
----

* Get sunrise/sunset times from openweathermap.org
* Parse xml to time or datetime
* compare time now with these times to return true/false

Further...
----------
To avoid having to call the weather web service every time:
 * function, called daily by cron to save the xml file locally
 * adjust is_daylight to read local file instead of api call 
   if its present, but fall back to the api call if file is missing.
